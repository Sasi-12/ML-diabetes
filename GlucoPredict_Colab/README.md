Diabetes, a pervasive and escalating health concern 
globally, poses significant threats such as blindness, stroke, 
kidney failure, hypertension, and heart attacks. With the 
International Diabetes Federation reporting approximately 
Four Hundred and Sixty-Three million cases in 2019 and 
projecting a staggering rise to 700 million by 2045, the 
urgency for early detection and intervention cannot be 
overstated. This study delves into the potential of machine 
learning algorithms in predicting diabetes, utilizing a dataset 
containing 14 crucial health attributes. Through a 
comparative analysis, we evaluate the performance of several 
machine learning algorithms including KNN (k-nearest 
Neighbors), 
Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic 
Regression, and AdaBoost. Employing supervised machine 
learning techniques, we scrutinize the dataset to discern 
patterns and correlations between health attributes and 
diabetes occurrence. Our findings reveal that the Random 
Forest algorithm outperforms all other  algorithms in 
diabetes prediction. This underscores the importance of 
selecting the appropriate machine learning technique tailored 
to the intricacies of the dataset. Moreover, our study 
underscores the transformative potential of machine learning 
in healthcare, providing a robust and reliable tool for early 
disease prognosis and prevention. Although the study aims to 
integrate both clinical and genetic data, the current 
implementation focuses solely on clinical attributes. Future 
work will incorporate genetic features to enhance predictive 
performance
